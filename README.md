# Sprint-Challenge Applied Javascript - Lambda Times

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored the DOM and the concept of components. During this Sprint, you studied the DOM, DOM Events, and Components. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating an online Lambda newspaper called "Lambda Times."

## Instructions

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your PM and Instructor in your cohort help channel on Slack. Your work reflects your proficiency in Applied JavaScript.

You have three hours to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly.

## Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your project manager.

## Description

You are going to create a Lambda Newspaper. Your job is going to be to add functionality to the tabs below the 'Lambda Times' logo. These tabs will act as filters for our articles, and when clicked on, should filter out all articles except those with that tag.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, you should have a console full of correct responses to the problems given.

## Self-Study Questions

Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

Edit this document to include your answers after each question. Make sure to leave a blank line above and below your answer so it is clear and easy to read by your project manager

1. What is the DOM?

DOM, an acronym which stands for Document Object Model, is the browser’s representation of a web page. DOM organizes the content of a web page in a tree like data-structure. DOM can be manipulated programmatically and is used by developers as an interface to structure, add, modify, delete the elements and the content on the page.

2. What is an event?

In web development, an event is considered to be something that occurs as a result of user interaction or other things like loading of page or some time interval.

3. What is an event listener?

An event listener is a program that keeps track whether an event has happened or not, and runs the code on the happening of that event. In DOM manipulation with JavaScript, an event handler can be created by `element.addEventListener()` method.

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

NodeLists array array like objects, but not arrays. Which means, they share some of the properties and methods of an array but not all. We cannot use many array methods on NodeList like map(), filter(), reduce(), etc. So, when we need to use these array methods, we can convert the NodeList to an array and run those methods on that new array.

5. What is a component?

In web development, components are parts or features that can be included in web applications and can be reused within the same web application or in multiple web applications. Web components are an integral part of DRY (don’t repeat yourself) programming.

### Git Set up

* [ ] Fork the project into your GitHub user account
* [ ] Clone the forked project into a directory on your machine
* [ ] Create a pull request before you start working on the project requirements.  You will continuously push your updates throughout the project.
* [ ] You are now ready to build this project with your preferred IDE

## Minimum Viable Product

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

* [ ] Look through the HTML code paying particular attention to the Tabs component and the Cards components. You will notice they share a data attribute. We will be using this data attribute to determine which cards should show when each tab is selected.

* [ ] Following the instructions in the `Tabs.js` file, complete the `TabLink`, and `TabCard` class components. It will look and feel very similar to the last project we worked on, but with a twist. Now, instead of one `Item` to display, we will need to display a collection of `Cards`. Think about ways to iterate over an array and manipulate each item.  **Note: You will need to un-comment the code after the lines of instructions.  The code is commented out so you can work error-free**

* [ ] Once you get your `Tab` component working properly add a couple more articles yourself and check out how it works.

## Stretch Problems

Your stretch challenge is to write the functionality of a `Carousel` component. You have the HTML and CSS already in place, simply un-comment the HTML in the `index.html` file. This is an advanced challenge, so you are not expected to be able to complete it. If you begin and don't finish, you should still submit with what you have. You may reference the `Tabs.js` file for assistance.

* [ ] Complete the carousel functionality in `Carousel.js`

* [ ] If you complete the Carousel, add functionality so that the carousel slides when the buttons are pressed instead of just appearing.

* [ ] Create an 'infinite loop' carousel. In which as long as you click on an arrow, the array of images will loop over itself.

* [ ] If you have finished the above, play around with the styling on all the components, and understand how each is built.
